# Discord-Role-Bot-PPG
A discord bot which will allow users to change their roles or 'teams'. 


To use this bot you must first configure a few things:
  1. Get your own Discord Bot Token. The reason it wasn't included here is becasue if someone else has asscess to the token they can control it remotely. 
  2. Role IDs are different for each server so they must be found every time this bot is added to a new server.
  3. Role IDs don't exist until you create the role in Discord. Therefore, to find a role ID, you must first create a role in your server.
  4. There's a commented out line of code on line 50 which will allow you to find information on all the roles in your server, including the ID.
  
  
I created this bot for a group of people who enjoy the cartoon Powerpuff Girls. The idea is you can create different roles, or 'teams', to choose to join. Right now this is just for fun and allows users to pick their favorite Powerpuff Girl. 

Roles were set up to have normal user privilages, and only changed the color in which their name was displayed. For example, a user on team Bubbles would have a blue name, and a user on team Buttercup would have a green name, and so on. 

This bot could be expanded to allocate points for teams who win trivia games or what not. The way it is now is purely for cosmetics.
